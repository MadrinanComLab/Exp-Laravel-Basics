TO RUN LARAVEL APP, ENTER ON THE COMMAND PROMPT (IN THIS DIRECTORY):
- php artisan serve

EXTERNAL CSS AND JS WILL BE STORED IN public FOLDER

COMMAND FOR CREATING LARAVEL CONTROLLER:
php artisan make:controller ControllerName

LOCATION OF THE CONTROLLER:
app/Http/Controllers

COMMAND FOR CREATING LARAVEL MIGRATION:
php artisan make:migration migration_name

LOCATION OF MIGRATION:
database/migrations

COMMAND TO RUN MIGRATION SCRIPTS:
php artisan migrate

NOTE: MAKE USE THAT Apache AND MySQL SERVERS WAS OPEN IN XAMPP BEFORE RUNNING THE MIGRATION SCRIPTS

THIS COMMAND WILL RE RUN THE MIGRATION SCRIPTS BUT WILL DROP EXISTING TABLE
php artisan migrate:fresh

// OPTION #1 FOR ADDING COLUMN TO A TABLE
IF YOU ADDED COLUMN TO YOUR TABLE YOU CANNOT UPDATE THE DATABASE IN THE SERVER BY JUST ENTERING
php artisan migrate

YOU HAVE TO ROLLBACK FIRST, TO ROLLBACK THE MIGRATION USE THIS COMMAND:
php artisan migrate:rollback

AFTER YOU ROLLBACK THEN ENTER THE COMMAND: php artisan migrate THEN THAT WILL UPDATE YOUR DATABASE

// OPTION #2 FOR ADDING COLUMN TO A TABLE
IN OPTION #1 IT WILL ADD THE NEW COLUMN BUT THE DATA STORED IN YOUR DATABASE WILL BE GONE. SO IN PRODUCTION IT WAS NOT
ADVISABLE TO USE, SO DO THIS INSTEAD:
1.) RUN THIS COMMAND: php artisan make:migration column_name_you_want_to_add_to_a_table | EXAMPLE: php artisan make:migration add_price_to_pizzas_table
// NOTE FOR THIS STEP: NAMING CONVENTION WAS IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS. YOU MUST DO IT SIMILAR TO THE GIVEN EXAMPLE
2.) RUN THIS COMMAND: php artisan migrate | NOW OPTION #2 IS DONE.

NOTE: SINCE THROUGH THE USE OF OPTION #2, THE NEW MIGRATION SCRIPT IS IN 2ND BATCH, IF YOU ROLLBACK IT, FIRST BATCH WON'T BE AFFECTED

COMMAND FOR CREATING ELOQUENT MODEL:
php artisan make:model Name | EXAMPLE php artisan make:model Pizza

LOCATION OF THE ELOQUENT MODEL:
app/Models

SOMETHING TO REFLECT WITH MIGRATION AND ELOQUENT MODEL:
BOTH OF THESE ARE FOR MANIPULATING DATABASE
* MIGRATION WAS FOR ADDING/CREATING TABLE AND DATABSES
* ELOQUENT WAS FOR ACCESSING DATA FROM SPECIFIC TABLE AND MANIPULATING DATA INSIDE DATABASE

MVC NAMING CONVENTION/CONTROLLER NAMING CONVENTION

                            PIZZA MODEL
Request    | Route            | Controller & Action     | View
-----------+------------------+-------------------------+----------
GET        | /pizzas          | PizzaController@index   | index
GET        | /pizzas/{id}     | PizzaController@show    | show
GET        | /pizzas/create   | PizzaController@create  | create
POST       | /pizzas          | PizzaController@store   | ---
DELETE     | /pizzas/{id}     | PizzaController@destroy | ---

THIS PROJECT USES SASS IN DESIGNING ITS PAGE. 
IN CASE YOU DON'T SASS IN YOUR NODE JS (AND YES YOU NEED NODE JS) ENTER THIS COMMAND USING BASH:
npm install node-sass --save
npm install sass
npm install sass-loader

THE COMMAND ABOVE WAS USED BECAUSE IN MY CASE I DON'T HAVE sass & sass-loader IN package.json

NOW THE GUY ON THE TUTORIAL USED npm install TO INSTALL mix IN THIS PROJECT AND THAT FILE IS webpack.mix.js

TO COMPILE OUR SASS ENTER THIS COMMAND USING BASH (RUN THIS COMMAND EVERY TIME YOU MADE CHANGES TO YOUR SASS FILE):
npm run dev

NOTE: MAKE SURE FILE YOU'VE CALLED IN wepack.mix.js WAS EXISTING, IF NOT IT WILL THROW AN ERROR

THIS COMMAND WILL ABLE TO COMPILE THE CHANGES EVERY TIME MAKE A CHANGES TO YOUR SASS FILE:
npm run watch

SOMETHING INTERESTING IN TUTORIAL VIDEO #24. WE RUN THE FF COMMAND:
1.) composer require laravel/ui (USING CMD)
2.) php artisan ui vue --auth (USING CMD)
3.) npm install (USING BASH)
4.) npm run dev (USING BASH)

FIRST THING YOU'LL NOTICE IF YOU GO TO:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

THERE IS A PAGE FOR LOGIN AND REGISTER, AND ALREADY HAS DESIGN AND AUTHENTICATION! I THINK IT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE IT SAVES US A LOT OF TIME

PROTECTING ROUTES (VIDEO #26)
FIRST WAY:
# middleware("auth") WILL CHECK IF USER HAS LOGGED IN TO ACCESS SPECIFIC ROUTE (THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY OF PROTECTING OUR ROUTES)
EXAMPLE OF IMPLEMENTING middleware() TO A ROUTE:
Route::get('/pizzas', [PizzaController::class, "index"])->middleware("auth"); # ControllerName@actionFunctionInController

SECOND WAY:
USED THIS IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT ALL ROUTES INSIDE A CONTROLLER CLASS
public function __construct()
{
    # THIS WILL PROTECT ALL THE ACTION INSIDE THIS CONTROLLER
    # BUT THERE IS AN ACTION HERE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO PROTECT SO IT WILL ALLOW THE ANNONYMOUS USERS TO ORDER A PIZZA
    # THESE ACTIONS ARE: create() AND store()
    $this->middleware("auth");
}

YOU CAN SEE THE CONTROLLER OF THE ROUTES AND OTHER DETAILS ABOUT USING THIS COMMAND (RUN THIS USING CMD):
php artisan route:list

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO NAME A ROUTE:
Route::get("/orders/pizzas/create", [PizzaController::class, "create"])->name("pizzas.create");

AND THIS IS HOW YOU USED IT:
<a href="{{ route('pizzas.create') }}">Order a Pizza</a>

IF YOU NEED TO PASS A VALUE/VARIABLE, YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
<a href="{{ route('pizzas.create', $pizza->id) }}"></a>

FOR NOW WE HAVE A MODEL, CONTROLLER AND MIGRATION (ALSO SOME ROUTES AND VIEWS) FILE FOR PIZZA
BUT IN CASE IN THE FUTURE YOU WANT TO ADD A NEW PRODUCT FOR EXAMPLE DRINKS, YOU CAN CREATE A MODEL, CONTROLLER AND MIGRATION FOR DRINKS
TO DO THAT, RUN THIS COMMAND:
php artisan make:model Drinks -mc
